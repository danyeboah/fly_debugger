These are biopython scripts I wrote as part of my undergraduate Senior Thesis at Princeton.
The aim of the computational part of the project was to predict potential primary and secondary structure motifs in the three-prime untranslated regions of mRNA of polar granule component (pgc), cyclin-B(cyc-B) and germ cell-less(gcl).
